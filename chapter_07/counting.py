# Introducing while Loops
# current_number = 1
# while current_number <= 5:
#     print(current_number)
#     current_number += 1

# Using continue in a Loop
# current_number = 0
# while current_number < 10:
#     current_number += 1
#     if current_number % 2 == 0:
#         continue

#     print(current_number)

# Avoiding Infinite Loops
# This while loop stops once x is equal to 5 
# but if x+=1 is ommitted it becomes an infinite loop 

# x = 1 
# while x <= 5:
#     print(x)
#     x += 1

# This while loop results in an infinite loop as 
# the value of x never changes and the condition to stop the loop is never met
# x = 1 
# while x <= 5:
#     print(x)
