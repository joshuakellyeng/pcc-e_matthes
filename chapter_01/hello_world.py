# 1.3 INFINITE SKILLS
# If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build?
# You’re about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you’ll
# have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to write brief
# descriptions of what you want to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas”
# notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take
# a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create.
